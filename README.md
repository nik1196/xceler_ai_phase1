# Running the app:
A server exists at apacheheli.pythonanywhere.com, but you can test your code locally using the python files provided.
server.py starts the server on the local host, and stage1_calc3.py is the module for processing the user input.
Two lines in MainActivity.java need to be commented out and replaced, while switching between the local and remote server.
To start the local server, run server.py. Change the ip address of the requests to the server in MainActivity.java if required.
Refer to 'test cases.ods' for the types of expressions it can recognise.
